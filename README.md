# power-simulation

This repository contains templates for running linear and logistic power simulations, based on Solomon Kurz's excellent blog posts (see below). A few parts of his original code have been updated or changed, and some things added, though the overall structure and content remain very similar; all credit therefore goes to Dr. Kurz.
