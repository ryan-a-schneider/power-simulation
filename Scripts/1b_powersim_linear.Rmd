## I. Generate practice sample

Step I is to create an sample of data that you think reflects the real-world differences between the conditions.

-   Using 2C:35-5 Manufacturing/Distributing a Controlled and Dangerous Substance (**1st degree**)
-   Penalty range for a pre-indictment plea ranges from 24 to 48 months (Row A). This represents the range the values of the DV could take.

```{r generate_data}

# define the means and SD's
mu_struc=36
sd_struc=10

mu_UNstruc=30
sd_UNstruc=10
  
# determine the group size
n <- 50


# simulate the data, making it reproducible
set.seed(1)

d1 <-
  tibble(group     = rep(c("structured", "unstructured"), each = n)) %>% 
  mutate(treatment = ifelse(group == "structured", 0, 1),
         y         = ifelse(group == "structured", 
                                      rnorm(n, mean = mu_struc, sd = sd_struc), 
                                      rnorm(n, mean = mu_UNstruc, sd = sd_UNstruc)))


d1 = d1 |> mutate(y_s=standardise(y))

# View the samples created
ggplot(d1, aes(x=y, fill=group)) + 
  theme_classic() +
  geom_density(alpha=.4)
```

## II. Create practice models

Now run linear regression to estimate the slope parameter in the sample above.

```{r practice_model_fit_check, results='hide', message=FALSE}

fit_lin=brm(data = d1,
            family = gaussian,
            formula = y ~ 1 + treatment,
            prior = c(prior(normal(33, 6), class = Intercept),
                      prior(student_t(5, 0, 9), class = b, coef="treatment"),
                      prior(lognormal(0, 5), class = sigma)),
            seed = 4,
            iter = 2500, chains = 2, cores = 2)


save(fit_lin, file=here::here("Models", "linear_power_fit.RData"))

#################### MODEL DIAGNOSTICS ##############################
diagnostic_posterior(fit_lin, diagnostic = c("ESS", "Rhat")) |> 
  mutate(Rhat_check=effectsize::interpret_rhat(Rhat),
         ESS_check=effectsize::interpret_ess(ESS))


#################### PARAMETERS AND EFFECT SIZE #################################
# check bayesian parameter estimates
describe_posterior(fit_lin, ci=.89, ci_method = "HDI",effects = "fixed",
                   rope_range = c(-0.2,0.2))

# Compare to frequentist model
lm(y ~ treatment, data = d1) |> parameters::model_parameters()
```

```{r practice_model_info}

############ check ROPE ############################

# non-standardized
rope(fit_lin, range = c(-1, 1), ci=.89, ci_method = "HDI", 
     effects = "fixed", 
     parameters = "treatment")


# view plot
plot(bayestestR::rope(fit_lin, ci=.89, ci_method="HDI", range=c(-1, 1))) + 
  theme_classic() +
  see::scale_fill_material()

```

## III. Simulate

Specify the number of simulations to be run, load the function, and then run the simulations.

-   **NOTE! If you changed the way that the data is generated in section I, then you need to change the simulation function below to be consistent with it!**

```{r simulation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}

# A. Set the number of simulations and sample sizes
n_simulations=2000


# B. Load function
sim_d_and_fit_linear <- function(seed, n) {
  
  set.seed(seed)
  
  d <-
    tibble(group     = rep(c("control", "treatment"), each = n)) |>  
    mutate(treatment = ifelse(group == "control", 0, 1),
           y         = ifelse(group == "control", 
                              rnorm(n, mean = mu_struc, sd = sd_struc), 
                              rnorm(n, mean = mu_UNstruc, sd = sd_UNstruc))) 
  
  crap=capture.output(new_fit <- update(fit_lin,
                                        newdata = d, 
                                        seed = seed))
                      
  params=bayestestR::describe_posterior(new_fit, ci_method = "HDI", ci=.89) |> 
    select(c(Parameter, Median, CI_low, CI_high)) |> 
    mutate(across(c(Median, CI_low, CI_high), round, 2))
}

# B. Run simulation

sim1_linear_n50 <-
  tibble(seed = 1:n_simulations) |>  
  mutate(tidy = map(.x= seed, .f= sim_d_and_fit_linear, n = 50)) |> 
  unnest(tidy) |> 
  mutate(width = CI_high - CI_low) |> 
  filter(Parameter!="b_Intercept") 

```

## IV. Check Results

### Method 1: Rejecting Null values

#### Quantifying width

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=7, dpi=300, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}

# view HDI widths as a histogram
sim1_linear_n50 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = width)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = NULL, color="skyblue")+
  labs(title = "Frequency Histogram of Interval Widths")

```

And we can check the descriptives out in a neat table...

```{r table}

sim1_linear_n50 |> 
  summarize('Median width'=median(width),
            'Mean width'=mean(width),
            'Narrowest width'=min(width),
            'Widest width'=max(width)) |> 
  mutate(across(everything(), round, 2)) |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = "HDI Summary Stat",
               values_to = "Value") 
```

#### Proportion of intervals that contain a Null effect

Check the proportion of the simulations that have a lower interval limit that is greater than 0; i.e., the proportion of simulations where the HDI/CI does not include 0.

```{r}
sim1_linear_n50 |>  
  filter(Parameter == "b_treatment") |>  
  mutate(check = ifelse(CI_low > 2, 1, 0)) |>  
  summarise(power = mean(check))
```

### Method 2: Precision of Estimation

> Once we're concerned with width size, about precision, the null hypothesis is no longer of direct relevance. And since we're no longer wed to thinking in terms of the null hypothesis, there's no real need to stick with a .8 threshold for evaluating 'width power.' Now if we wanted to stick with .8, we could. Though a little nonsensical, the .8 criterion would give our AIPE analysis a sense of familiarity with traditional power analyses, which some reviewers might appreciate. But in his text, Kruschke mentioned several other alternatives. One would be to set maximum value for our CI wdiths and simulate to find the n necessary so all our simulations pass that criterion. Another would follow Joseph, Wolfson, and du Berger (1995) who suggested we shoot for an n that produces widths that pass that criterion on average.

Here is a demonstration and explanation of all three versions of AIPE criteria.

#### A. Targeting a specific width

Even if your posterior suggests the difference between your groups is not zero, the Credible Interval or HDI might still be pretty wide on the size of the effect; so you could know *enough* to say "the effect isn't zero", but still be very uncertain about what it *actually is.* So...

> ...instead of focusing on rejecting a null hypothesis like $μ_{control}=μ_{treatment}$​, we might instead use our simulation skills to determine the sample size we need to have most of our intervals come in at a certain level of precision. This has been termed the accuracy in parameter estimation [AIPE; Maxwell et al. ([2008](https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/blog/bayesian-power-analysis-part-ii/#ref-maxwellSampleSizePlanning2008)); see also Kruschke ([2015](https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/blog/bayesian-power-analysis-part-ii/#ref-kruschkeDoingBayesianData2015))] approach to sample size planning.
>
> Thinking in terms of AIPE, in terms of precision, lets say we wanted widths of 0.7 or smaller.

This code shows the probability of achieving an interval width of (x desired size) or less, for a given sample size.

```{r}

target_max_width=.7

sim1_linear_n50 |> 
  mutate(check = ifelse(width < target_max_width, 1, 0)) |> 
  summarise(`width power` = mean(check))
```

#### B. Kruschke's minimum-threshold criterion

The difference between this and the above is that Kruschke recommends getting *100%* of the widths below the target. The general target approach above just aims for some arbitrarily acceptable proportion (e.g., 70 or 80%) of HDI's below the desired threshold. This approach ensures that all intervals will be precise.

First, it can be helpful to view the distribution of widths, to see if some of the widths are approaching the the "too wide" boundary.

```{r}

# visual check of the widths' distribution
sim1_linear_n50 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=width)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = NULL, color="red")

# checking the proportions
sim1_linear_n50 |> 
  mutate(check=ifelse(width<target_max_width, 1, 0)) |> 
  summarize('proportion below target'=mean(check))
```

#### C. Mean-precision criterion

This is Joseph, Wolfson, and du Berger's (1995) suggestion to aim for an n that produces widths of a certain number, on average.

```{r}
sim1_linear_n50 |> summarize('average width'=mean(width))
```

## V. More Simulations

If you did not achieve your goal(s) in the first simulation, increase the sample size and re-run it here. The higher the sample size, the more narrowly the interval width should be around the true data-generating value. Keep increasing the sample size and re-running the simulations in this section until you meet your goals.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}

# Run more sims

sim2_linear_n65 <-
  tibble(seed = 1:n_simulations) |>  
  mutate(tidy = map(.x= seed, .f= sim_d_and_fit_linear, n = 65)) |>

  unnest(tidy) |> 
  mutate(width = CI_high - CI_low) |> 
  filter(Parameter!="b_Intercept")



# compile all objects into a single list, with the sample size as the name for each level

```

### Check Results

For the custom function:

-   `effect_direction` is the direction of the effect you created when you generated the idealized data in step one. Is there an increase or decrease

-   `target_width` is for setting a goal for a minimum level of precision (cannot be empty, must supply a number)

-   `null_value` is the value to test against. Can either be 0 for a traditional Null Hypothesis test, or the upper or lower boundary of the ROPE, if doing an equivalence test. Use the lower boundary if the direction is negative, or the upper boundary if it's positive.

    -   see `bayestestR::rope_range()` and the web page tutorial here for suggestions on ROPE values

```{r}
# Method 1: Check one model at a time

sim2_linear_n65 |>  
  check_power_precision(effect_direction="negative", target_width = 5.7, null_value= -2)

##################### Method 2: DO FOR ALL AT ONCE with purrr ###############

# For i in list .x, apply function .f
linear_sims |> 
  map(.f= filter, Parameter=="b_treatment") |> # may be necessary if you have lots of effects
  map_df(.f= check_power_precision, 
         effect_direction="negative", 
         target_width = 5.0, null_value= -1) |> 
  mutate(sample_size=names(linear_sims))
```
